  return `In a faraway kingdom, nestled amidst rolling hills and sparkling rivers, lived a young princess named Snow White. With skin as white as snow, lips as red as a poppy, and hair as black as night, Snow White's beauty was legendary. But her true beauty radiated from her kind heart and gentle spirit.
However, in the castle walls resided another woman, the Queen, Snow White's stepmother. This Queen, known for her vanity and jealousy, possessed a magic mirror that spoke the truth. Every day, she would ask, "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"
For many years, the mirror would reply, "You are, Your Majesty!" This pleased the Queen immensely, for she desired nothing more than to be the most beautiful in the land.
One day, as the Queen stood primping in front of the mirror, a chilling response echoed through the room. "My Queen, though you are fair, Snow White is far fairer than you."
The Queen's blood ran cold. Rage and envy consumed her. How dare a mere child outshine her? Blinded by jealousy, the Queen devised a wicked plan to get rid of Snow White.
She ordered her faithful huntsman to take the princess deep into the forest and never return. The huntsman, who was kind-hearted and could not bear to harm the young princess, took her far into the woods but let her go, leaving her to find her way.
Terrified, Snow White ran deeper into the forest, tears streaming down her face. The trees whispered and the birds chirped, but all she felt was fear and loneliness.`;
